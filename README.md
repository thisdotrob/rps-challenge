# Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)

## About

This is my solution to the third of the weekend challenges set on the Makers Academy course.

The application aims to filfill the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

and we were given the following hints on functionality:

```
- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
```
